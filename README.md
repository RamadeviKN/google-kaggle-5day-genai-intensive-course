🚀 Future Project Ideas

Day 1: Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation

AI-powered Blog Writer:
Build a system that generates high-quality blog posts on different topics by feeding it a brief input. You can use foundational LLMs like Gemini and customize the generation flow based on specific user instructions.

Custom AI Assistant:
Create an intelligent AI assistant that can help answer questions, summarize articles, and even generate email drafts using a pre-trained LLM. Use prompt engineering to refine the output and improve user interaction.

Day 2: Prompt Engineering

Advanced Search Engine:
Develop a search engine that understands user queries deeply by using advanced prompts and parameters to fetch more relevant results. You can leverage embedding models for text similarity and LLMs to interpret ambiguous queries.

Personalized Content Generator:
Build a system where users provide a short description of their content needs (e.g., topic, tone, audience), and the LLM generates personalized content for them, such as reports, articles, or social media posts.

Day 3: Generative AI Agents

AI-Powered Customer Support Agent:
Create an AI chatbot for customer support that can interact with a product database, answer customer questions, and perform functions like order tracking or FAQs. Integrate it with an existing system via function calling.

Restaurant Ordering System:
Build a LangGraph-powered AI ordering system for a restaurant where customers can interact with the system to place orders, customize their meals, and receive personalized recommendations based on menu items and past orders.

Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs

Medical Knowledge Extraction Tool:
Develop a domain-specific LLM to process and answer medical-related queries from a corpus of research papers or medical textbooks. Use techniques like grounding with Google Search for the most up-to-date information.

Legal Document Analyzer:
Create an LLM model trained on legal documents that can assist with summarizing contracts, providing insights on legal clauses, and offering suggestions for clause improvements. Fine-tune a Gemini model on custom labeled legal data for specialized tasks.

Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI

Automated AI Model Deployment System:
Build an MLOps pipeline that automates the deployment of Generative AI models (e.g., text generation, summarization) into production. This system could manage model training, versioning, testing, and rolling out updates seamlessly.

Real-time Data Integration System:
Develop a real-time data pipeline that integrates live data from multiple sources (social media, news, databases) to update and fine-tune a generative AI model continuously, ensuring the model adapts quickly to new trends and information.

Additional Projects Idea:

AI-Powered Research Assistant:

Combine Foundational LLMs, Domain-Specific LLMs, and MLOps to create a research assistant that can help researchers by summarizing papers, generating new research ideas, conducting literature reviews, and even querying a research database using function calling. This assistant would incorporate fine-tuned models, embeddings, and real-time data updates.
Generative AI-driven Content Creation Platform:

Build an end-to-end platform that allows users to generate various forms of content (blogs, articles, emails, product descriptions, etc.) using fine-tuned LLMs for specific domains like marketing, law, or medicine. The system would integrate MLOps for easy scaling and deployment and fine-tune LLMs using Google Search data and other specialized datasets for more accurate results.

Keep up the great work and dive deep into the material — we look forward to seeing your journey unfold together by applying the skills gained! Good luck!
