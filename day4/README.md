Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs 🧠🔍

Welcome to Unit 4 of the 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Workshop by Google and Kaggle! This unit focuses on Domain-Specific LLMs, exploring how specialized large language models (LLMs) are created and applied to tackle specific problems in various fields.

📚 Learning Objectives
In this day 4 of GenAI training, one can learn below concepts:

Dive into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM (Security LLM) and MedLM/Med-PaLM (Medical LLM).
Gain insights from the researchers behind these models to understand how domain-specific challenges are addressed using tailored LLMs.
Explore how to extend a model's capabilities beyond its knowledge cut-off using real-world data and fine-tuning techniques.

💡 What You’ll Learn
Reading: Learn about the unique aspects of developing domain-specific LLMs by reading the "Solving Domain-Specific Problems Using LLMs" whitepaper.
Podcast: Listen to the summary podcast episode to gain additional insights and understand key takeaways.
Code Labs:
Google Search Data Integration: Learn how to enhance a model's outputs by incorporating real-time data from Google Search.
Fine-Tuning a Gemini Model: Master the process of tuning a Gemini model for specific tasks using your own labeled dataset.

🛠️ Code Labs
Two hands-on code labs are included in this unit.
Use Google Search Data in Generation: Learn how to enrich generative models with real-time data.
Tune a Gemini Model for a Custom Task: Practice fine-tuning a pre-trained model using your dataset to adapt it for domain-specific tasks.
