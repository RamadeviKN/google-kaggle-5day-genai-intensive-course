Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases üîçüß†

Welcome to Day 2 of the 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Workshop by Google and Kaggle! This unit focuses on the powerful concepts of embeddings and vector databases, enabling enhanced search, classification, and semantic understanding for AI applications.

üí° What You‚Äôll Learn
In this day 2 of GenAI training, one can learn below concepts:

Understand the foundational concepts of embeddings and how they represent textual data in a high-dimensional space.
Learn about vector stores/databases and their role in integrating live or specialist data into LLM applications.
Explore the geometrical capabilities of embeddings for tasks like text similarity and classification.

üõ†Ô∏è Code Labs Overview
Dive into hands-on exercises to solidify your understanding.
Build a RAG Question-Answering System Over Custom Documents: Learn to integrate embeddings with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to answer queries using your own documents.
Explore Text Similarity with Embeddings: Understand how embeddings can measure the similarity between different texts, uncovering semantic relationships.
Build a Neural Classification Network with Keras Using Embeddings: Utilize embeddings to train a neural network for text classification tasks, leveraging the power of Keras.
